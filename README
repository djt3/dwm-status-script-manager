# dwm-status-script-manager
A very simple posix compliant script for adding other shell scripts to the status bar in dwm

Includes some simple shell scripts and an example config. To install, extract to your home directory in a folder called ".scripts". The script should be run on boot, for example by adding "~/.scripts/./run.sh &" to the end of your vimrc, before the window manager is opened

To add a script to the config (scripts.conf) the format is simply "(scripts name) (how often to update (seconds))".
