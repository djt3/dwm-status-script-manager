Includes some simple shell scripts and an example config. To install, extract to your home directory in a folder called ".scripts". The script should be run on boot, for example by adding "~/.scripts/./run.sh &" to the end of your xinitrc, before the window manager is opened

To add a script to the config (scripts.conf) the format is simply "(scripts name) (how often to update (seconds))".
